## Getting stared

#### Requirements

#### Running the server

Before starting the servers, you need to provide some environment secrets.

Please create a .env file by running

`touch .env`

Your .env file needs to have the following properties to run:

-   MONGODB_URI
-   TOKEN_SECRET

Feel free to supply your own MongoDB URL if you have one. The Token Secret is just a random string used for hashing. Otherwise, we prepared a test database, you will just need to copy and paste it.

```
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://codeuni:unfortunatelycleartext@cluster0.z5lpzob.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
TOKEN_SECRET="64e49888ea55824fe86c1030daf7bfe1ccafba546522ab237ea5480305ec93a26d1c494042e72ff5c4c0f2942762438fd4ec305081782baeda9f0ce160d0ecc6"
```

To run the server locally, please run

`npm run dev`
